# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

**NOTE:** install as the user that will be using the dotfiles, do not use `sudo`.

**NOTE 2:** dotfiles repo should be cloned to /home/\$(USER)/dotfiles directory.

## Requirements

-   neovim
-   tmux

Requirements can be installed with an the included target:

```bash
make install-requirements
```

## Usage

```bash
make install  # install dotfiles
make remove   # uninstall dotfiles
```

## Customization

### bashrc

The bashrc will source a local bashrc file (at '~/.bashrc.local') if it exists. This allows you to write per-computer bashrc customizations that aren't version controlled in the repository (and therefore aren't synced between machines).
